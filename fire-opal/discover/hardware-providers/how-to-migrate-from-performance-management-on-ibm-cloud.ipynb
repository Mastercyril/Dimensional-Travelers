        "In November 2023, Q-CTRL announced that the same AI-driven error suppression technology that powers Fire Opal was natively integrated within the Qiskit Runtime Service on IBM Cloud. This was a significant industry moment as the first native software integration of a third-party vendor on the IBM Quantum Platform. The integration paved the way for the launch of the IBM [Qiskit Functions Catalog](http://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions) inside the IBM Quantum Platform — new abstracted services that simplify utility-scale computing on IBM Quantum systems.\n",

        "If you would like to continue leveraging Q-CTRL in your workflow, please note the following migration options:\n",
        "- If your organization has an existing IBM Quantum Premium Plan instance: you can get access to the [Performance Management Function](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions?id=q-ctrl-performance-management), found in the Qiskit Functions Catalog.\n",
        "- If you would like to continue using Qiskit Runtime via IBM Cloud (Pay-as-you-go): you can use Fire Opal to access the same performance management directly through Q-CTRL. You can connect your IBM Cloud API key and Qiskit Runtime CRN to Fire Opal."
